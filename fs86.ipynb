The Stoics, who were Greek philosophers of the third century B.C. were the first logicians to organize logic aximatically. In contrast, natural deduction systems are relatively new; Gerhard Gentzen, a German logician, and Stanislaw Jaskowski, a Polish student of Jan Lukasiewicz, independently proposed the first natural deduction systems in 1934. The system of htis book owes a great deal, as well, to innovations by the American logicians Willard van  Orman Quine, Frederic B. Fitch, Donald Kalish and Richard Montague.\n",
