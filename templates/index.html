## What is Mad Mode?

My day job is writing software to support research at
the [KU Med Center informatics division][bmi], though I'm best known for
[my work on HTML and Web Architecture at W3C][w3c].

[bmi]: https://informatics.kumc.edu/work/
[w3c]: http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/

I'm a family man, which gives a certain perspective on the <a href="{{ url_for('search_tag', tag='KC') }}">KC</a> area,
<a href="{{ url_for('search_tag', tag='america') }}">America</a>, and
the <a href="{{ url_for('search_tag', tag='world') }}">world</a> we live
in.

Between all that, I like to tinker.  The bane of my existence is doing
things I know the computer could do for me.  Have you ever had one of
those ideas that won't let go, not even to eat or sleep? My mom said
the first time she saw me like that was after they gave me tinker-toys
for my 3rd or 4th Christmas. She said I was in "mad scientist mode,"
just like my father, a chemistry professor.
