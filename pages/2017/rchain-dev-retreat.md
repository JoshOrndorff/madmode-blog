This year I was invited to a [Blockchain meets Object Capabilities
panel][SFO] in San Francisco July 3 and the [RChain developer retreat][SLC]
in Park City Nov 12-17.

[SLC]: https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/191

My flight to San Francisco was funded from the [$30 that I put into
Ethereum][eth] in mid 2016--as an educational expense, I thought; I
hardly expected to square my investment.

Jorge Lopez of [Gravity][] hosted long-time capabilities leaders Mark
Miller, Zooko Wilcox, and Brian Warner as well as Arthur Breitman of
[Tezos][]. Zooko also represented [Zcash][].

Brian gave a great summary of the bitcoin market forces but I was too
engrossed in the event to take notes; the one quote I managed to write
down was "Satoshi is probably in the room."

The evening before the panel, @zooko gave a [shout][z84] out to my
[awesome-ocap][] list, and in a [reply from @robertobrien][ro], I
discovered [RChain's Namespace Logic][ns].

I saw Mike Stay's name, which was familiar from [cap-talk][]
discussion, on some of the citations in the RChain Architecture
document, and asked him some questions in email. Before long I was
contributing [little tweaks][PR40] to the code and wrangled an
invitation to the developer retreat.

Again, I was too engrossed to take good notes, but they made
[recordings of the main sessions][v16].

The RChain goals are ambitious, to say the least: "content delivery at
the scale of Facebook and transactions at the speed of Visa." Not to
mention a an "e pluribus unum 2.0, a new center on a scale-invariant
axis reconciling the wisdom of collective and the wisdom of the
individual" for collaborating on problems such as global warming.  An
[interview with Greg Meredith][GM] from the [January RChain
announcement][jan11] filled in a lot of the background for me.
