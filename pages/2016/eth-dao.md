# On investing in Etherium and DAO tokens


I'm the proud owner of ~250 DAO tokens, I think. I can't confirm on [the creation page](https://daohub.org/creation.html) but I have a receipt:
[0x1be4715b9fc0e3b6c6793f6d27ba1ca00d4a47d9b4ab1fe51fa456a33adde355](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1be4715b9fc0e3b6c6793f6d27ba1ca00d4a47d9b4ab1fe51fa456a33adde355)

read some stuff on https://daohub.org/; several links and several pages in, I find a proposal for a generalized airbnb.
follow-the-money seems to lead to slock.it

The DAO is rewarding - er... any argument to back that claim? a simple 3-point argument that there's some ROI in here... is that too much to ask?
The DAO is code -- OK, that's something I understand. Though the code is kinda scary. All imperative.

The VM is nearly ocap-happy; *what was the one exception I found?*

OK... so how do I do it?

and there's a wizard... it recommends paying eith ETH, but I don't have any, so I choose USD,
so they refer me to bity
  - register button wouldn't light up when I used a password manager to enter a password
    - had to manually type a char and then delete it
  - when I ordered some ETH, they gave me international bank transfer instructions, not a credit card form.

mist takes forever to sync... and eats disk space in ~/.ethereum without really telling you what's going on

> As an additional safety feature, if a fast sync fails close to or after the random pivot point, fast sync is disabled as a safety precaution and the node reverts to full, block-processing based synchronization.
