> The OLIAS Web Index demonstration software supports one client and two server configurations. The client configuration requires a Sun SPARC workstation running SunOS 4.1.x (Solaris 1.1.1), up to 350MB of disk space, and either X11R5 or Open Windows. The server configurations can be a machine on the client system's LAN that is connected to the Internet and running either a SOCKS server or a Web proxy server process.
